# SimSight Project
The goal of this project is to quantify the contribution of modeling and simulation in the regulatory approval of medical devices. The approach was to develop an open source tool that allows the user to search publicly available 510(k) and PMA databases by keywords. 

The project was initiated the summer of 2019. For more details see **Poster_SimSight_2019.pdf**

Current working version: 

- Python Script: SimSight.py
- Jupyter Notebook: SimSight.ipynb
- Jupyter Notebook with plot: SimSight-Demo

## Team ##
